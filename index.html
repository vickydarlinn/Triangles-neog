      <h2>What is triangle?</h2>
      <p>
        As the name suggests, the triangle is a polygon that has three angles.
        So, when does a closed figure has three angles? When it has three line
        segments joined end to end. Thus, we can say that a triangle is a
        polygon, which has three sides, three angles, three vertices and the sum
        of all three angles of any triangle equals 180°.

      <h2>Properties of a triangle</h2>
      <p>These are the properties of a triangle:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A triangle has three sides, three angles, and three vertices.</li>
        <li>
          The sum of all internal angles of a triangle is always equal to 180°.
          This is called the angle sum property of a triangle.
        </li>
        <li>
          The sum of the length of any two sides of a triangle is greater than
          the length of the third side
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Types of triangles</h2>
      <p>Triangles can be classified in 2 major ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Classification according to internal angles</li>
        <li>Classification according to the length of its sides</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Classification of a triangle by internal angles</h2>
      <p>Based on the angle measurement, there are three types of triangles:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Acute Angled Triangle</li>
        <li>Right-Angled Triangle</li>
        <li>Obtuse Angled Triangle</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Let us discuss each type in detail.</p>
      <h3>Acute Angle Triangle</h3>
      <img
        src="images/Properties-of-triangle-Acute-angled-triangle-1024x518.png"
        alt=""
      />
      <p>
        A triangle that has <strong>all three angles less than 90°</strong> is
        an acute angle triangle.
      </p>
      <h3>Right-Angle Triangle</h3>
      <img
        src="images/Properties-of-triangles-RIght-angled-triangle-Pythagoras-theorem-1024x485.png"
        alt=""
      />
      <p>
        A triangle that has
        <strong>one angle that measures exactly 90°</strong> is a right-angle
        triangle.
      </p>
      <h3>Obtuse/Oblique Angle Triangle</h3>
      <img
        src="images/Properties-of-triangles-Obtuse-angled-triangle-1024x522.png"
        alt=""
      />
      <p>
        A triangle that has
        <strong>one angle that measures more than 90°</strong> is an obtuse
        angle triangle.
      </p>
      <h2>Classification of triangles by length of sides</h2>
      <p>
        Based on the length of the sides, triangles are classified into three
        types:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Scalene Triangle</li>
        <li>Isoceles Triangle</li>
        <li>Equilateral Triangle</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Let us discuss each type in detail.</p>
      <h3>Scalene triangle</h3>
      <img
        src="images/Properties-of-triangles-Scalene-triangle-1024x473.png"
        alt=""
      />
      <p>
        A triangle that has
        <strong>all three sides of different lengths</strong> is a scalene
        triangle.
      </p>
      <h3>Isosceles triangle</h3>
      <img
        src="images/Properties-of-triangles-Isosceles-triangle-1024x511.png"
        alt=""
      />
      <p>
        A triangle that has
        <strong
          >two sides of the same length and the third side of a different
          length</strong
        >
        is an isosceles triangle.
      </p>
      <h3>Equilateral triangle</h3>
      <img
        src="images/Properties-of-triangles-Equilateral-Triangle-1024x616.png"
        alt=""
      />
      <p>
        A triangle which has
        <strong>all the three sides of the same length</strong> is an
        equilateral triangle.
